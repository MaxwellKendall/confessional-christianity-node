This project exists for the benefit of the Church. We love the reformed heritage as it is laid out in the confessions and catechisms of the 16th and 17th centuries because we believe they faithfully communicate to us the majesty our our God and the accurate teaching of Holy Scripture. The intent of this application is to help you grow in your knowledge, and therefore in your love, of our Triune God.

The main functionality that this application brings in distinction from other projects is the ability to search the confessions of faith by scripture or scripture reference. For example, a search for ["John 3:16"](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=John+3%3A16) will yield results similar to ["should not perish but have eternal life"](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=should+not+perish+but+have+eternal+life). You may also search by [keywords across all documents](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=baptism), [keyword filtered by a document](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=document:WCF%20baptism), or of course you can also [read through the a document bit by bit](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=document:WCF%20chapter:3).

## Our Content
While we acknowledge the bounds of confessional christianity extends beyond the reformed tradition, it is for good reason that the age of the protestant reformation is considered [the age of confessionalism](https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany/The-confessional-age-1555-1648). At this time, this site includes the following historic documents from this time period:

- [The Westminster Confession of faith](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=document:WCF)
- [The Westminster Shorter Catechism](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=document:WSC)
- [The Westminster Larger Catechism](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=document:WLC)
- [The Belgic Confession](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=document:BC)
- [The Heidelberg Catechism](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=document:HC)
- [The Canons of Dordt](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=document:COD)
- [The Thirty Nine Articles of Religion](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=document:TAR)
- [Martin Luther's 95 Theses](https://confessionalchristianity.com/?search=document:ML9T)

There are many lesser known catechisms and confessions which may be surfaced here in the future.

We would like to acknowledge the makers of [Reformed Standards](https://reformedstandards.com/) for their excellent work.

We hope this website is of some use to you as you grow in the knowledge of our LORD and Savior Jesus Christ. May God bless us richly as we seek to grow in the knowledge of his Son, and in doing so, love him more as we ought.
